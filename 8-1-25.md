### 1. What is the difference between `transfer` and `send`? Why should they not be used?
##### 1. **`transfer`**

- **Gas Limit**: Fixed at **2300 gas** to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Behavior on Failure**: **Reverts** the transaction if the transfer fails.
##### 2. **`send`**

- **Gas Limit**: Fixed at **2300 gas**, similar to `transfer`.
- **Behavior on Failure**: Returns a **boolean** (`true` for success, `false` for failure) instead of reverting the transaction.

While `transfer` and `send` were once considered secure, there are several reasons why they are discouraged in modern Solidity development:

1. **Gas Limit Constraints**:
    
    - The **2300 gas limit** may not be sufficient for complex contract interactions (e.g., if the recipient contract has fallback or `receive` functions performing additional logic).
    - Gas costs are no longer constant and can fluctuate, leading to failures even for simple operations.

**Migration to `call`**:
- The **`call` method** is now the recommended way to send Ether. It provides flexibility, allows specifying gas limits, and handles failures gracefully.


### 2. What is a storage collision in a proxy contract?
**Storage collision** occurs in proxy contracts when the storage layout of the **proxy contract** overlaps with the storage layout of the **implementation (logic) contract**, leading to corrupted or unintended data being read or written.

##### **Why Storage Collisions Happens**
Storage slots are shared between the proxy and implementation. Solidity assigns storage slots sequentially for state variables:

1. The **first declared variable** is assigned slot 0.
2. The **second variable** is assigned slot 1, and so on.

If both contracts define variables in the same slots, they overwrite each other's data.
##### **Example of Storage Collision**

 **Proxy Contract**
```js
contract Proxy {
    address public implementation; // Slot 0
    address public admin;          // Slot 1

    fallback() external payable {
        (bool success, ) = implementation.delegatecall(msg.data);
        require(success, "Delegatecall failed");
    }
}
```

**Implementation Contract**
```js
contract Logic {
    address public user;           // Slot 0 (conflicts with `implementation` in Proxy)
    uint256 public balance;        // Slot 1 (conflicts with `admin` in Proxy)

    function setUser(address _user) public {
        user = _user;
    }
}
```

**Mitigation** : Use standards like **EIP-1967** or gaps to safely manage storage in proxy patterns.


### 3. What is the difference between `abi.encode` and `abi.encodePacked`?

### **`abi.encode`**

1. **Encoding Type**:
    
    - Encodes data in **ABI (Application Binary Interface) format**.
    - The output is tightly packed and padded to 32-byte boundaries (as per the ABI specification).
2. **Use Case**:
    
    - Used when precise ABI-compliant encoding is required, such as when calling a function in another contract or when you need data for `call`, `delegatecall`, or `staticcall`.
3. **Padding**:
    
    - Adds padding to ensure each argument occupies a multiple of 32 bytes.
    - Useful for complex data types like arrays, structs, and strings.
4. **Output**:
    
    - Always returns a **bytes** array.

### **`abi.encodePacked`**

1. **Encoding Type**:
    
    - Encodes data in a **tightly packed format**, without adding padding.
    - Concatenates data directly in the smallest possible space.
2. **Use Case**:
    
    - Useful for generating compact data representations, such as when hashing data with `keccak256`.
3. **Padding**:
    
    - Does **not** add padding or align data to 32-byte boundaries.
    - May cause ambiguity in the encoding of different data types.
4. **Output**:
    
    - Always returns a **bytes** array.

### 4. What changed with `block.timestamp` before and after proof of stake?

##### **Before PoS (Proof of Work)**

1. **Source of `block.timestamp`**:
    
    - Miners determined the block timestamp.
    - Miners could manipulate the timestamp within reasonable bounds to optimize mining rewards (e.g., by adjusting for favorable difficulty or gas pricing).
2. **Validation Rules**:
    
    - The timestamp had to satisfy:
        - `block.timestamp > parentBlock.timestamp`
        - `block.timestamp` was roughly synchronized with real-world time but could deviate slightly.
3. **Implications**:
    
    - Timestamp manipulation:
        - Miners could slightly manipulate the timestamp within a window of about 15 seconds or more, leading to potential attacks on time-dependent contracts.
        - Example: In lottery contracts or contracts with deadlines, miners could cheat by manipulating timestamps to increase their chances of winning.

##### **After PoS (Proof of Stake)**

1. **Source of `block.timestamp`**:
    
    - Validators propose block timestamps.
    - Validators are required to set the timestamp close to the actual time as perceived by their local clock.
2. **Validation Rules**:
    
    - The timestamp must satisfy stricter conditions:
        - `block.timestamp > parentBlock.timestamp`
        - `block.timestamp ≤ currentTime + SLOT_DURATION` (where SLOT_DURATION is typically 12 seconds in Ethereum PoS).
    - Validators are punished for proposing invalid timestamps that deviate too far from real-world time.
3. **Implications**:
    
    - Tighter bounds on timestamp manipulation:
        - Validators can no longer significantly manipulate timestamps as they are closely tied to the network's slot duration (12 seconds).
        - Timestamp deviations are typically small and bounded, reducing risks for time-dependent contracts.

### 5. What is frontrunning?

**Frontrunning** is a type of attack or exploit in blockchain systems where a malicious actor observes a pending transaction in the network and submits their own transaction with higher gas fees to get it mined before the original transaction. This allows the attacker to gain an unfair advantage or profit.

### 6. What is a commit-reveal scheme and when would you use it?

A **commit-reveal scheme** is a cryptographic method used to prevent frontrunning by splitting a process into two phases:

1. **Commit Phase**: Users submit a hash of their input (e.g., a bid or choice) along with a nonce, concealing the actual value.
2. **Reveal Phase**: Users reveal the original input and nonce, which is verified against the hash.
##### **When to Use**
- **Auctions**: To hide bids until all participants have committed.
- **Voting**: To ensure votes remain secret until everyone has cast theirs.
- **Games**: To prevent players from reacting to others' moves prematurely.

### 7. Under what circumstances could `abi.encodePacked` create a vulnerability?

Using `abi.encodePacked` can introduce vulnerabilities in **Solidity** when it creates **ambiguous encodings** that lead to potential **hash collisions**, especially in contexts involving `keccak256` for hashing or signature generation.

### 8. What is the effect on gas of making a function `payable`?

Making a function `payable` decreases the cost to deploy and call the function. Non-payable functions include additional opcodes to verify that `msg.value` is zero and revert the transaction if any Ether is sent. Payable functions skip this check, leading to fewer opcodes to execute when the function is called and resulting in a smaller contract bytecode.

### 9. How does Ethereum determine the BASEFEE in EIP-1559?
The BASEFEE is adjusted on a block-by-block basis using a formula that targets a 50% full block (where target gas used is 15M for a 30M gas limit block). Here's how it works:

1. If the current block gas used > target:
    - BASEFEE increases by a maximum of 12.5% for the next block
    - Formula: next_basefee = current_basefee * (1 + 1/8 * (current_gas_used/target_gas_used - 1))
2. If the current block gas used < target:
    - BASEFEE decreases proportionally
    - Uses the same formula, which results in a decrease when gas used is below target

For example:

- If a block is 100% full (30M/30M gas), BASEFEE increases by 12.5%
- If a block is 75% full (22.5M/30M gas), BASEFEE increases by ~6.25%

### 10. What is the difference between a cold read and a warm read?

A cold read occurs when you access a storage slot for the first time within a transaction. The EVM has to retrieve this data from disk storage, which is more computationally expensive. In terms of gas costs, a cold read costs 2100 gas.

A warm read happens when you access the same storage slot again within the same transaction. Since the data is already loaded into memory from the first (cold) access, it's much cheaper - only 100 gas.

```js
contract StorageExample {
    uint256 public value1;
    uint256 public value2;
    
    function example() external {
        uint256 a = value1;    // Cold read (2100 gas)
        uint256 b = value1;    // Warm read (100 gas)
        uint256 c = value2;    // Cold read (2100 gas)
    }
}
```

### 11. How does an AMM price assets?

Automated Market Makers (AMMs) price assets using the constant product formula:

The core concept is based on the formula $x * y = k$, where:

- $x$ = quantity of token A
- $y$ = quantity of token B
- $k$ = constant product

For example, if a pool has:
- 10 ETH $(x)$
- 20,000 USDC $(y)$
- $k$ = 200,000

The current price of ETH in this pool would be:
- Price = $y/x = 20,000/10 = 2,000$ USDC per ETH

When someone wants to trade, the AMM maintains k by adjusting quantities. For a trade of $Δx$ ETH:

- New $y = k/(x + Δx)$
- The price impact increases with larger trade sizes

Key points about AMM pricing:

1. The price automatically adjusts based on supply and demand
2. Larger trades have higher price impact due to the curve shape
3. The formula ensures infinite liquidity (though at increasingly worse prices)
4. Arbitrageurs help keep AMM prices aligned with broader market

For example, if someone buys 1 ETH from our pool:

- New $x$ = $11$ ETH
- New $y$ = $200,000/11 ≈ 18,182$ USDC
- They pay: $20,000 - 18,182 = 1,818$ USDC
- This price is better than the initial spot price because it's a relatively small trade

This model has variations like:
- Weighted pools (Balancer)
- Concentrated liquidity (Uniswap v3)
- Stableswap curves (Curve)

### 12. What function modifiers are valid for interfaces? What is the difference between `memory` and `calldata` in a function argument?

**Valid Interface Function Modifiers:**

Interface functions can only use these modifiers:
- `external`
- `view`
- `pure`
- `payable`

Notably, interfaces cannot use:
- `internal`
- `private`
- `virtual` (all interface functions are implicitly virtual)

**Memory vs Calldata in Function Arguments:**

The key differences between `memory` and `calldata` are:

1. Storage Location:
    - `memory`: Creates a copy of the data in memory
    - `calldata`: References the data directly from the transaction input
2. Mutability:
    - `memory`: Data can be modified
    - `calldata`: Data is read-only
3. Gas Cost:
    - `memory`: More expensive as it requires copying data
    - `calldata`: Cheaper as it avoids copying


### 13. Describe the three types of storage gas costs for writes.

1. Store a new variable: 20,000 gas
2. Updating state: 5,000 gas
3. Reading state: 200 gas

### 14. Why shouldn’t upgradeable contracts use the constructor?

The core issue is that constructor code is executed only once during contract deployment and becomes part of the contract's creation code, not the runtime code. With proxy patterns, the constructor code runs in the implementation contract's context, not the proxy's context, meaning:

1. State variables initialized in the constructor will be set in the implementation contract, not the proxy
2. These values won't be accessible through the proxy's `delegatecall` mechanism

### 15. What is a signature replay attack?
A **signature replay attack** occurs when an attacker intercepts a cryptographic signature used for authorizing a transaction or action and reuses it in a different context to perform unauthorized operations. This is particularly relevant in blockchain systems where transactions are stateless and independent.
##### **How a Signature Replay Attack Works**
1. **Transaction Creation**:
    
    - A user signs a message or transaction off-chain using their private key. The signature typically proves their intent to execute a specific action.
2. **Transaction Replay**:
    
    - An attacker intercepts this signed message and resends (or "replays") it to the same or a different contract to execute the same operation again without the user’s consent.

### 16. What is a function selector clash in a proxy and how does it happen?

A function selector clash happens when two functions have the same 4-byte identifiers.
This identifier depends on the name and parity of the function,

In the case of a proxy, and plus particularly of a transparent proxy, a same function with the same arguments can be defined in the proxy and its implementation resulting in a function clash.

In this scenario, we have to know if the sender tries to call the function defined in the proxy or the function defines in its implementation.

The solution implemented by the OpenZeppelin team is to use a proxy admin to control the proxy.

- If the admin calls the proxy, the call is not delegate and the function called is the function defined in the proxy.
- If the call came not from the admin, the call will be delegate to the implementation contract.

### 17. How would you design a game of rock-paper-scissors in a smart contract such that players cannot cheat?

use the _commit-reveal scheme_
Each player commit its choice under the form `hash(choice, salt)`

Once the two players have commit their choice, the two players call the function `reveal`with their salt.

The smart contract computes the hash with the salt, and can compare the choice of the two players to determine which players won.

### 18. Why doesn’t Solidity support floating point arithmetic?

Ethereum blockchain is deterministic which ensures that smart contracts always produce the same output for the same input.

With floating point number, you can have a loss of precision and a difference between node computation which is not compatible with the deterministic nature of Ethereum.

### 19. According to the solidity style guide, how should functions be ordered?

Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:
- constructor
- receive function (if exists)
- fallback function (if exists)
- external
- public
- internal
- private

Within a grouping, place the `view` and `pure` functions last.

### 20. According to the solidity style guide, how should function modifiers be ordered?
he modifier order for a function should be:

1. Visibility
2. Mutability
3. Virtual
4. Override
5. Custom modifiers

### 21. What is gas griefing?
Gas griefing is an attack technique that allows a malicious user to prevent users from executing transactions when there's no external call success check. It can be done by providing just enough gas to execute a top-level transaction, and then censoring the data so that the original user can't execute it later.

### 22. What keywords are provided in Solidity to measure time?
- 1 == 1 seconds
- 1 minutes == 60 seconds
- 1 hours == 60 minutes
- 1 days == 24 hours
- 1 weeks == 7 days

### 23. What is TWAP?
TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) - is a pricing algorithm used to calculate the price of an asset for a period of time. It can be done by taking different prices at equally distant points in time and then dividing the sum of them by the length of the points:

For example, imagine we wanted to calculate the TWAP of an asset over one minute using 15-second price point intervals. If the prices were $100 at zero seconds, $102 at 15 seconds, $101 at 30 seconds, $98 at 45 seconds, and $103 at 60 seconds, then to calculate the TWAP we would sum all price points (100, 102, 101, 99, 103) and then divide them by the number of timepoints (five). In this example, the TWAP is $101.

### 24. What is fee on transfer token?
ERC20 tokens that take a small fee on their transfer is known as fee on transfer tokens.

### 25. What are rebasing tokens?
Rebase token is a type of ERC20 token that changes its total supply (by burning/minting tokens) to maintain a peg to a certain value, they are very similar to stablecoins in idea but not in implementation.

### 26. What does ERC721A do to reduce mint costs? What is the trade-off?

ERC721A is a new implementation of ERC721 pattern but with some upsides and downsides: Upsides:
- mints are much cheaper

Downsides:
- transfers are more expensive

Mint optimization technique: it doesn't update all default mappings with info about token owner on each mint, it does it once during batch mint. Because of this, you don't have information about the tokenId owner, so you have to iterate the array first to find the owner of the token.

### 27. If a proxy makes a `delegatecall` to A, and A does `address(this).balance`, whose balance is returned, the proxy's or A?
`address(this)` will return the address of the proxy, so it will return the proxy's balance.

### 28. How does Compound Finance calculate utilization?
Utilization - percentage of actually borrowed funds in the lending pool compared to the total funds available for borrowing.

```js
Utilization = TotalBorrows / TotalSupply;
```

### 29. How large a `uint` can be packed with an address in one slot?
In Solidity, a **`uint`** and an **`address`** can each take up 32 bytes (256 bits) of storage. A single **storage slot** in Ethereum smart contracts is 32 bytes, so **only one of these values can be fully packed into a single slot** without exceeding the slot size.
##### Packing a `uint` with an `address`
- **A `uint256`** takes up 32 bytes.
- **An `address`** takes up 20 bytes.

Since a storage slot is 32 bytes, **you cannot pack a full `uint256` and an `address` together in one slot** without wasting space. However, you can pack smaller `uint` values (e.g., `uint128` or `uint160`) alongside an `address` in the same slot.
### 30. Which operations give a partial refund of gas?
1. **Selfdestruct (formerly Suicide)**:
    
    - When a contract calls `selfdestruct(address)`, it removes the contract from the blockchain and refunds part of the gas used for the contract’s storage.
    - This refund occurs because the contract's storage is wiped, and the Ethereum network reclaims that space for future use.
    - **Refund**: It refunds up to 24,000 gas for the removal of contract storage.
2. **SSTORE with Zero Value**:
    
    - When a contract writes a zero value to a previously set non-zero storage slot (i.e., setting a storage variable from a non-zero value to zero), it triggers a **gas refund**.
    - **Refund**: Writing a zero value to a storage slot refunds **15,000 gas**.

### 31. What is ERC165 used for?
**ERC-165** is a standard for detecting whether a smart contract implements a specific interface. It defines a method `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)` that allows contracts to declare which interfaces they support, enabling other contracts or applications to check for the availability of specific functionalities before interacting with them.

### 32. What is a gas efficient alternative to multiplying and dividing by a power of two?
##### **Bitwise Shift Operations**:
- **Multiplication by a power of 2** can be achieved by a **left shift (`<<`)**.
- **Division by a power of 2** can be achieved by a **right shift (`>>`)**.
### 33. If a `delegatecall` is made to a function that reverts, what does the `delegatecall` do?
It will return `false` and won't revert the calling function.

### 34. What is a sandwich attack?
A **sandwich attack** is a type of **front-running** exploit in decentralized finance (DeFi) where an attacker:

1. **Buys** an asset just before a large trade is executed (driving the price up).
2. **Waits** for the large trade to execute, causing the price to rise further.
3. **Sells** the asset immediately after the large trade, profiting from the price increase.

This attack takes advantage of transaction ordering on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to manipulate prices and profit at the expense of other users.

### 35. How does `safeMint` differ from `mint` in the OpenZeppelin ERC721 implementation?

- **`mint`**: This function mints a new token and assigns it to a specified address without any safety checks. It can be vulnerable to certain issues like transferring to the zero address or minting to an address that cannot receive tokens.
    
- **`safeMint`**: This function mints a new token but includes additional safety checks. It ensures that the recipient address can properly handle ERC721 tokens by calling the `onERC721Received` function if the recipient is a contract. This prevents tokens from being sent to contracts that do not support ERC721.

### 36.  What is a bonding curve?
A **bonding curve** is a mathematical concept used in decentralized finance (DeFi) and token economics to determine the price of a token based on the supply of the token in circulation. It is typically represented as a continuous curve that defines the relationship between the token's price and its supply.

##### How It Works
- **Supply-Price Relationship**: As more tokens are bought or minted, the price of the token increases according to the bonding curve formula.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: The price isn't fixed; it changes depending on how many tokens have already been issued, and the curve often becomes steeper as supply grows, leading to higher prices for later buyers.

### 37. What danger do ERC777 tokens pose?
ERC-777 tokens pose a **security risk** due to their **operator functionality**, which allows an approved address (operator) to transfer tokens on behalf of a user without direct interaction. The main dangers include:

1. **Unintentional Token Transfers**: Users might unknowingly grant operators the ability to transfer their tokens, leading to loss of control over their funds if the operator is malicious or compromised.
    
2. **Reentrancy Attacks**: The ERC-777 `send` and `operatorSend` functions trigger a callback function (`tokensReceived`), which could be exploited in reentrancy attacks if the recipient contract doesn't handle reentrancy properly.
    
3. **Misuse of `approve` Mechanism**: If operators are not managed carefully, attackers could use them to perform unauthorized transfers by tricking users into approving malicious operators.

### 38. If a contract delegatecalls an empty address or an implementation that was previously self-destructed, what happens? What if it is a regular call instead of a `delegatecall`?
It will return true, because even though the storage is empty for that address, the EVM still recognizes the existence of this address and decides that the `call`/`delegatecall` was successful.
### 39. `uint8`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `uint128`, `uint256` are all valid `uint` sizes. Are there others?

Yes, all`uint8` to `uint256` in steps of `8` (unsigned of 8 up to 256 bits)
For example, there is also `uint16`, `uint24`, `uint40`…
