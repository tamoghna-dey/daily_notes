#### Title : Loss of funds for a user due to incorrect updating of state while unstaking
#### Vulnerability detail
If an user tries to unstake tokens in the current epoch, which are stakes in a previous epoch the `unredeemedEpoch` variable is updated wrongly. 
The protocol doesn't differentiate between unstaking in current epoch and previous epochs, leading to unintended update of `unredeemedEpoch` variable. The users rewards will be lost.

The problem flow is 

1. Alex deposits 10tokens in epoch 5. `unredeemedEpoch` = 5 (as current epoch is 5)
2. He deposits 12tokens more in epoch 10. `unredeemedEpoch` = 10 (as current epoch is 10)
3. He unstakes 10 tokens deposited previously in epoch 5. Now `unredeedmedEpoch` is updated to 0. But it should not be zero. 
   If it is set to zero the rewards of tokens staked in epoch 10 will be lost. Basically he would get no rewards.
#### Impact
user rewards are lost
#### Mitigation
Add checks that will take into account that `unredeemedEpoch` should be set to 0 only if the `currentEpoch == _epoch`

**Key takeaway** : The attack vector is valid if the user first stakes new tokens then unstakes tokens from the previous epoch, in the current epoch. The way this works is interesting. I should pay more details about different time variations. This is not a very complex issue, it is very evident when we read but works in a particular condition. Being able to imagine that condition in which this would be valid is important.

#### Title : Incorrect `block.timestamp` check allows user to bid after the auction is finished, which enables user to claim more token than they are eligible.
#### Vulnerability detail
In the `auctionEnd()` function a variable `multiplier` is calculated on the basis of total bids, if this value is inflated it allows user to claim more tokens than they are eligible. 
```js
multiplier = totalTokens.mul(PRECISION_18).div(totalBids);
```

```js
    function bid(uint256 amount) external {
    @>  if (block.timestamp > auctionEndTime) {
            revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();
        }

        bids[msg.sender] = bids[msg.sender].add(amount);
    @>  totalBids = totalBids.add(amount);

        fjordPoints.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        emit BidAdded(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

The `if` statement in `bid()` function performs a wrong check, it only checks if the `block.timestamp` is greater than the end time. Which would allow the user to bid even after the auction has ended i.e. when `block.timestamp = auctionEndTime`.

This would increase the `totalBids` . Which in turn would decrease the value of `multiplier`, as we can see from above. 

```js
        function claimTokens() external {
        if (!ended) {
            revert AuctionNotYetEnded();
        }

        uint256 userBids = bids[msg.sender];
        if (userBids == 0) {
            revert NoTokensToClaim();
        }

@>        uint256 claimable = userBids.mul(multiplier).div(PRECISION_18);
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;

@>        auctionToken.transfer(msg.sender, claimable);
        emit TokensClaimed(msg.sender, claimable);
    }
```

So lower `multiplier` means higher `claimable` amount. Hence user is able to earn more than they are eligible.

#### Impact
User can claim more tokens than they are eligible
#### Mitigation
update the `if` statement in `bid()` and `unbid()` function to :
```js
if(block.timestamp >= auctionEndTime){
	revert AuctionAlreadyEnded();
}
```

**Key takeaway** : It's so easy to spot, and it's interesting to see how just a change from `>` to `>=` can change the whole thing. Attention has to be paid at granular level.


#### Title : Auction tokens will be lost forever in case the auction ends without any bids.
#### Vulnerability detail

The person who deploys `FjordAuctionFactory.sol` contract i.e. `msg.sender` becomes the owner of the contract.
```js
    constructor(address _fjordPoints) {
        if (_fjordPoints == address(0)) revert InvalidAddress();

        fjordPoints = _fjordPoints;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
```

The `FjordAuctionFactory.sol` contract deploys a new instance of `FjordAuction` contract to create a new auction in the `createAuction()` function. And the specified amount of auction tokens are transferred from the `msg.sender` to `auctionAddress`
```js
    function createAuction(
        address auctionToken,
        uint256 biddingTime,
        uint256 totalTokens,
        bytes32 salt
    ) external onlyOwner {
        address auctionAddress = address(
            new FjordAuction{ salt: salt }(fjordPoints, auctionToken, biddingTime, totalTokens)
        );

        // Transfer the auction tokens from the msg.sender to the new auction contract
        IERC20(auctionToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, auctionAddress, totalTokens);

        emit AuctionCreated(auctionAddress);
    }

```

Someone calls `auctionEnd()` function, in case of no bids the function will execute this `if` statement :
```js
        if (totalBids == 0) {
            auctionToken.transfer(owner, totalTokens);
            return;
        }

```

Here we can see that the tokens are transferred to the `owner` address. But the `owner` of this contract is `FjordAuctionFactory.sol` and that contract do not have any method to transfer the funds to the actual deployer of the contract. Hence auction tokens are locked.
#### Impact
Auction tokens are locked in `FjordAuctionFactory` contract, in case there are no bids.
#### Mitigation
Implement a method in the `FjordAuctionFactory` contract so that the owner can withdraw their tokens.

**Key takeaway** again this occurs in a specific condition where there are no bids, which leads to a series of malfunctioning of different functions. Ultimately leading to locking of funds. A lot of people found it, which shows that it is pretty easy to track but they were able to think keeping the precondition of no-bid situation in mind which lead to discovering of the issue. I need to check functions in different scenarios in mind. 

#### Title Epoch mismatch in FjordToken and FjordStaking leads to unfair reward distribution
#### Vulnerability detail
The `FjordStaking` contract depends on the address of `FjordToken` contract for deployment. Both the contracts can be deployed at seperate times leading to mismatch in epochs, which leads to unfair reward calculation for user. 

The users won't have to stake their tokens for the entire period of time but they will receive full rewards for that time period, which is not intended.
#### Mitigation
Both the contracts have to be deployed in a single transaction, `FjordToken` first because `FjordStaking` depends on the other contract's address for deployment.
or
Have the same time variable for both of the contracts.

**Key takeaways** : as easy at it looks this fetched $95 as reward. The vulnerability lies in just a line which leads to a series of malfunctions. The researcher whose report got selected went a step further to show that this issue actually exists in the current test net deployment of the protocol. Both the contracts are actually deployed 10 blocks apart. This wasn't a unique precondition or an edge case this was pure logic.

I do not have proper knowledge of sablier and it's working, the finding is related to the protocols misconfiguration with sablier, which leads to unintended situations. But the finding is written beautifully, great explanation and poc.

#### Title Wrong parameter used in event 
#### Vulnerability detail
According to the documentation, the first argument of the event should be 'the total number of points distributed.' But the event emitted in the function uses `pointsPerEpoch` as the first parameter which is incorrect.

```js
FjordPoints::distributePoints()

emit PointsDistributed(pointsPerEpoch, pointsPerToken);
```

#### Impact
The front-end might show wrong values.
#### Mitigation
use `totalPoints` instead of `pointsPerEpoch`

**Key takeaway** can you believe this finding fetched $795 as reward? the interesting part is only 4 people found it. And there is only one Low finding in this contest. This one low paid more than all the highs and mediums combined. And what is the finding? wrong event parameter. All I can say is shame on me. To win at this this is how deep one should go.
