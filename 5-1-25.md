# Zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) : basics

What are ZKPs?
In cryptography, ZKPs are proofs that confirm the validity of a statement without revealing any other information about the validity of that statement. 

Types of ZKPs
- Interactive : multiple back and forth communication between verifier and prover
- non-interactive : single round of communication between verifier and prover

Interactive ZKPs were the initial iteration of ZKP, but it is not suitable for blockchain as it's unsuitable for independent verification.

Non-interactive ZKPs on the other hand involves only one round of communication. Once prover sends a query the verifier either marks it as right or wrong. That's it.

Types of non-interactive ZKPs
- ZK-STARKS : Zero knowledge scalable transparent argument of knowledge
- ZK-SNARKS : Zero knowledge succinct Non-interactive argument of knowledge

# Transparent upgradable proxy

Proxy contract is a smart contract which acts as a middle layer between users and actual implementation logic of a dApp. It's purpose is to allow upgradability while maintaining the same contract address and preserving state.

Types of proxy contracts :
- Beacon proxy
- Transparent proxy
- Universal upgradable proxy standard
- Minimal proxy (ERC 1167)

#### Transparent upgradable proxy
The Transparent Upgradable Proxy is a design pattern for upgrading a proxy while eliminating the possibility of a function selector clash.

**Function selector clashing problem**
When public functions are declared inside the proxy contract to update the implementation address, introduces the possibility of a function selector clash.

There can be two kinds of function selector clashes that can occur :
1. If the contract implementing the proxy contract has a function with the same function signature, that function will be un-callable because proxy's public function with same sig will be called, not fallback. So if fallback is not triggered, there won't be `delegatecall` to the implementation contract.
2. if implementation contract has the same function selector as the public function in the proxy contract it will still be un-callable for similar reason. But in this case it can randomly happen that the four bytes match.

Transparent upgradable proxy solves this problem.
