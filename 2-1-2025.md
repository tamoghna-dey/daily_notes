# Rollups vs Validium vs Alt L1s

reference video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygOZsu1HXMk&ab_channel=JarrodWatts

Above three are the classification of Layer 2 solutions built on top of ethereum. 

Layer 2 includes
- rollups : submits proofs + tx data to ethereum
- validium : submits only proofs to ethereum
Layer 1 
- Disconnected sidechain, server, alt L1 : commitments or nothing

The argument that vitalik makes in his blog is : 
The more secure you want you L2 to be the more costlier it would be. So naturally rollups are costlier than validiums but validiums are much more easier and efficient to scale.

But both have their own usecases.
If one is building a de-fi product like games or social media applications, validium would be a better option to choose. Because there is mass micro txs. 
If one is building a complex de-fi product like lending protocol/ staking protocol it might be a better option to use rollups because they are more secure.

On the contrary in case of a hard fork or a 51% attack on ethereum, basically if anything goes wrong on ethereum the more dependent the Layer 2 chains are on ethereum the more likely they are to be affected by the attack/ fork. 

Alt L1s or alternate blockchains, are blockchains other than bitcoin like ethereum/ solana/ kadena etc. But some alt L1s occasionally submit commitments to ethereum.

# Vulnerabilities related to Fee-on-Transfer tokens

**What are Fee-on-transfer tokens?**
As the name suggest : there is a fee on the transfer of tokens. In simple words if we transfer x amount of token we will have to pay y% on the total amount as fees. So we receive less than what we transfer because a percentage is paid as fees. Also known as deflationary tokens.

let's say we transfer 10 tokens, there is 0.01% fees on transfer of each. After the tx passes we receive : $10 - 10*0.01 = 10 - 0.1 = 9.9$ tokens

**How can this lead to vulnerabilities?**
As we see we don't receive the total amount of which we transfer because of the fees. 
Most causes of vulnerabilities are due to 
- incorrect accounting of contract balances : some contracts might not account the actual amount of tokens because a percentage of it will be used as fees on transfer
- incorrect reward calculations : reward distribution systems might mis-calculate rewards based on the assumption that tokens in circulation remain constant, but the fees would be subtracted during transfer which depletes the total amount of tokens. This can lead to wrong reward calculations also late claimers might not have rewards left due to fees. 
- duplicate fees : some contracts might apply the fees twice due to the wrong understanding of fee on transfer mechanisms.
- failed deposit : in certain vaults or protocols, deposits might fail if FOT tokens are used. This happens when the contract is supposed to receive exact amount of tokens but due to FOT mechanism it receives less than expected.
