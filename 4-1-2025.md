# Layer 2 sequencers

### 1. What are sequencers?
As the name suggests, sequencers determine the sequence of txn before they are added to the blockchain. The sequencing is done according to certain rules. This is important as accuracy of txn ordering prevents conflicts and helps maintain integrity of the blockchain. When users submit tx in a L2 blockchain the txn stays in the mempool. The sequencers read the the txn and executes them then batch txn together and send to L1.

### 2. Types of sequencers
1. Centralized 
2. Decentralized
3. Shared

#### Centralized sequencers
Currently most popular L2s like optimism, arbitrum, linea, base, etc have centralized sequencers. 
Why ? 
Because centralized sequencers provide best performance and most users on L2s care about performance. 
How?
As the txn are processed in house, they are most likely going to be valid most of the time. Hence less time to prove = less time to withdraw.
But centralized sequencers have their cons too!
Ofcourse it's centralized = single point of failure ; and we don't want centralized systems to be used in a decentralized world.
No interoperability between chains; each L2 have in house sequencers which can only process txn of that specific L2 chain.

#### Decentralized sequencers
The pros and cons are just reversed in this case as compared to centralized sequencers. It's good because it is decentralized but it's slower in performance. Currently [Metis](https://www.metis.io/) uses decentralized sequencers.

> [! NOTE]
> Both centralized and decentralized sequencers do not provide any cross chain interoperability.


#### Shared sequencers
The problem : No cross chain interoperability for users & developers
The solution : Shared sequencers

Shared sequencers operate a separate blockchain for multiple rollups to introduce interoperability advantages. Shared sequencers serve multiple chains.

My understanding is, there is a protocol who runs a separate blockchain to provide decentralized sequencing services. And different L2 chains can opt in to use their services, which would improve interoperability.

Cons of shared sequencers :
- You as a L2 chain give up the responsibility of your chains' sequencer away to another network. Which includes
	- control over MEV collection
	- control over censorship resistance
	- performance
	- upgrade or modify operator.

# Layer 0

LZ is an onmichain interoperability protocol, which facilitates seamless communication between different blockchain networks. LZ uses Decentralized Verifier Networks and Executors to enable cross chain communication. 
Key components
- Oracle and Relayer
- Ultra light nodes
Use cases
- cross chain token transfers
- omnichain dApps
- cross chain governance

How it works from a users' perspective?
When a call is executed from on a user application in the source chain, the contract interacts with LayerZero Endpoint. The endpoint notifies Oracle and Relayer of the message and it's destination chain. 

Oracle waits for a particular number of block confirmations specified by user, then forwards the block header to endpoint on destination chain. Relayer then submits the transaction proof. Proof is then verified and message is forwarded to the destination address. 

The LZ team has created Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFT) and Omnichain Non-Fungible Tokens (ONFT) to make bridging of tokens easier. They are ready-to-use contracts which can be implemented with minimal customization. 

*There is much more details and nuances on how LZ achieves crosschain interoperability, I still need to study that.*

# Oracle vulnerabilities

reference : https://zokyo-auditing-tutorials.gitbook.io/zokyo-tutorials/tutorial-15-oracles

**Issue with single oracle dependence**
The impact is fairly easy to understand here, depending on a single oracle means a single point of failure in-case things go wrong. Unforeseen situation might lead to incorrect price feed data and affect the whole protocol.

**Lack of return data validation, this includes**
- Stale Data from Latest Answer
- Incomplete round check
- misunderstanding oracle's return data
- ignoring timestamps

**Vulnerabilities related to using DEXs as oracle** 
Spot price can be easily manipulated by taking flash loans while using DEXs as oracle.
It's safer to rely on Time weighted Average Price (TWAP) which takes the average price of a token over a specified duration, as it's hard to manipulate.
